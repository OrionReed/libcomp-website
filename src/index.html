  <b>LC</b> is a loose collective of researchers, artists, and activists working to liberate computing from capitalism.

<div id="intro">
  <div id="para">
    <p>We live under a <em>capitalist mode of computing</em>. The tools, languages, techniques, and assumptions of
      digital systems and structured by economic forces that shape not just what we <em>can do</em>, but what we can <em>imagine
        doing</em>. By separating <strong>production</strong> from <strong>use</strong>, producing <strong>inflexible
        software</strong>, and slicing up computing into <strong>siloed apps</strong>, your agency is held back by a
      tech industry that benefits from a population rendered <em>computationally passive</em>.</p>
    <p>We seek to <em>catalyze discontent</em> with the state of computing and firmly believe that a better computing is
      possible. Only by understanding the history of paths-not-taken and closely examining processes of production,
      labor conditions, power structures, and ideological influences, can we understand the winding path towards a <em>liberatory
        computing</em>.</p>
