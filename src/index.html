  <div id="para">
    <p>We live under a <em>capitalist mode of computing</em>. The tools, languages, techniques, and assumptions of
      digital systems are structured by economic forces that shape not just what we <em>can do</em>, but what we can
      <em>imagine
        doing</em>. By separating <strong>production</strong> from <strong>use</strong>, producing <strong>inflexible
        software</strong>, and slicing up computing into <strong>siloed apps</strong>, your agency is held back by a
      tech industry that profits from a population rendered <em>computationally passive</em>.</p>
    <p>We seek to <em>catalyze discontent</em> with the state of computing by understanding the roles of production,
      labor, and power in shaping the foundations of digital systems.</p>
