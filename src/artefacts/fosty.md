summary: It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. colonialism, and patriarchal models of the world.

I really dont have anything to say but I need there to be some words here so that I can see how things are looking on the site... We live under a capitalist mode of computing. The tools, languages, techniques, and assumptions of digital systems are —and always have been— aiding and entrenching exploitative labor relations, hierarchical power structures, colonialism, and patriarchal models of the world. Your agency is constrained and shaped to extract profit, by separating programmers from users and organizing around software commodities — real agency is a threat to a trillion dollar industry and so we are told that this is just how technology works.
